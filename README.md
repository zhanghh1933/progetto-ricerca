# Progetto di ricerca su Sharing di immaggini

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need python 3.7 or higher, pip for package manager and if you want you can use virtual env.

Matlab version R2018b, or compatible.

Some tex editor for editing the autogenerated report from the python code. I'm using TeXstudio.

### Installing

Clone the repository and then open it as a project of pycharm.

Once is open in pycharm then make sure that a correct interpreter is selected in File -> Settings -> Project:...  -> Project interpreter

When everything is ready, open a console and then install all the requirements with the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the package needed.

Now from ........ download the dataset and copy into the project folder in the way that the structure
of the folder will be exactly this:

```
project
├───dataset_complete
│   ├───messenger
│   ├───original
│   ├───telegram
│   └───whatsapp
├───double_sharing
│   ├───messenger
│   │   ├───messenger
│   │   ├───telegram
│   │   └───whatsapp
│   ├───telegram
│   │   ├───messenger
│   │   ├───telegram
│   │   └───whatsapp
│   └───whatsapp
│       ├───messenger
│       ├───telegram
│       └───whatsapp
├───matlab
│   ├───functions
│   └───libs
│       ├───jpeg-8
│       ├───jpeg_toolbox
│       └───ZIG_ZIG_SCAN
├───output
├───report
└───src
```
Be sure of the structure bucause inside the codes there are binding for those folders.

Inside the folder `output` there will be some `.mat` file, that are the features extracted from 
the images. If there are no file you can generate them by executing two Matlab file:

```
single_scenario_extract_features.m
double_scenario_extract_features.m
```

e qui andra altro

Now you are ready to start ^^

## How to work

Work inside of src folder

Put the new code that is for the competition into 'code' and in libs are some usefull libs.
Instead into source put all the json files that you need, do not commit those file because 
they are really big :)
